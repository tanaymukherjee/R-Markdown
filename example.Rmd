### Example Workflow of the shiny project

* Pick a dataset
* Save the dataset to a sqlite database
* Build user interface in ui.R
* Build server backend in server.R
    + Write query to extract the data from database according to user input
    + Use dplyr/tidyr to preprocess the data if needed
    + Use ggplot2/plotly/googleVis/leaflet to visualize your data


### R code chunks
```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

```{r load_library, message=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r bar_plot, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=9, dev='png', fig.path='./figure/'}

library(ggplot2)
    
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = color)) +
    
geom_bar(aes(fill = cut), position = "dodge")
    
```

### Introduction

+ NYC's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) conducts unannounced inspections of restaurants at least once a year to check food handling, food temperature, personal hygiene, and vermin control. Since 2010, NYC restaurants have to prominently post their Grade (e.g. A/B/C) which empowers diners with decision-making information and incentivizes establishments to improve their hygiene.

+ Download the csv file from [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j) and rename it to `data.csv`. Move the file to the same directory of your markdown file and use relative path to read it.

### Load dataset
**You need to change eval=TRUE after you move the data.csv in the same directory**
```{r load_data, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(data.table)
raw.df <- fread("./data.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
raw.df <- as.data.frame(raw.df)
str(raw.df)
```
